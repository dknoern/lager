Includes original box.  

The first photoelectric clocks provided energy storage by mechanically winding a spring that would continue to drive the movement. The idea of a light-powered mechanism that could provide additional storage in an electronic accumulator, was that of  Patek Philippe & Co. A patent for this revolutionary idea for photoelectric energy was awarded Patek Philippe in 1954. It was such a novel idea that it was exhibited at the 1955 World Symposium and displayed at the Museum of Science in Boston.

Patek Philippe continues to produce a few of these light-powered Dome table clocks each of which features the signature form of a rotating top dome featuring an aperture for the photo-electric cell and tri-panel sides which form a visual narrative.  Though the majority of these fine clocks feature artisan cloisonn enamels, they also made engraved gilt brass models like this one, elegant in its simplicity, with the focus directed toward function rather than merely its form.

Roberts by the Texas Volunteer Guard commemorating his retirement, July 1, 1895, having joined the Volunteer Guard, forerunner of the Texas National Guard as a Lieutenant in its first year, 1870. This watch was the highest grade timepiece made during the era. Only the very wealthy could have afforded a watch of this quality. Personalized dials were extremely rare. This unique and perfect dial is OHara style with the words Major General and it is further personalized with a beautiful blue center and what appears to be the seal of the state of Texas from that time. The original heavy 14k case shows little wear and has no dents or dings. It is a multi-color gold box hinge case, N size, Deer grade (highest quality). The back cover features crossed sabers, bayonet mounted carbines, two Major General insignias, as well as laurels matching those on the dial. The Generals 3-letter monogram is intricately engraved on the front cover.
